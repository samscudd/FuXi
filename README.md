# FuXi
Welcome to FuXi!  An open source app for studying flashcards any way you want to study them.

Although there are a plethora of modern flashcard apps out there, few provide you with the means to study flashcards in your own way.  Thus, the goal of this project is to provide an open source playground to anyone who wants to have the flexibility of handmade flashcards on their phone!
